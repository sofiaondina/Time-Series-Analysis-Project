# Time-Series-Analysis-Project

The project aims to define, develop and validate a predictive system for time series data.
Models to implement:
• at least one ARIMA model
• at least one UCM model
• at least one non-linear predictive model (Machine Learning)
The dataset is contained in the “TrainingSet.csv” file.

Target
Predict the trend of the VALUE time series from 2020-09-01 to 2020-10-31 (2 months) using the MAE as a measure of the error.
